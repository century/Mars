        <h1>Log 2</h1>
        <p>This week has been good. I have figured out (partially) what I want my memex to look like, and have also made my own photo site. I have found it easier to read books than I remember, and can think of a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>That I am reading one book at a time</li>
<li>That my view of computers has become more negative (that is, I wish to use computers less)</li>
<li>I am reading particularly good books.</li>
</ul>
<p>The books I am reading (and have read recently) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quinn's <em>Ishmael</em></li>
<li>Borges' <em>Fictions</em></li>
<li>Camus' <em>The Stranger</em></li>
<li>Carse's <em>Finite and Infinite Games</em></li>
</ul>
