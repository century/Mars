        <h1>Log 3</h1>
        <p>A field. Knee-height grass. Surrounded by beautiful trees.
A Cube. 20 feet on all sides. Golden color, but faded with time. Corners are weathered; blunt.
A ladder. Leaning on the Cube.
A horse. Doing nothing, not wanting to do anything. Elegant in its inaction.
Flowers. In small patches. Colorful, but understated. Nothing you would take a picture of, but something you would lie down in.
A Storm. Far off, but imminent. Not a bad stormâ€”welcome. A beautiful storm that will reinvigorate the field and the animals in it.</p>
